## Description

Glossary app: Highlight a term at its own URL, along with a definition, example, details, related terms, aliases, etc. Allow community updates (wikipedia-style, anyone can contribute) via standard CRUD routes. Use an API for spell check, or for converting Markdown to HTML.

Stretch goals: admin approvals, flash-card mode, multi-lingual support. This is a project I could see future teams working on as well, building on your efforts.
